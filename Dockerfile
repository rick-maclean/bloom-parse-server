#NOTES for developers
# When doing development it might be prudent to build your own Docker image and push it 
# to a repo where is can be pulled from (Referenced in Dockerrun.aws.json since it might 
# be to slow to wait for it to update on https://hub.docker.com/r/silintl/bloom-parse-server/
#
# To Build the image do something like this.
# $ docker build -t yourhubdockeraccount/bloom-parse-server .
#
# To be able to push it to hub.docker.com log in
# $ docker login
#
# The credentials file would be needed if the repo were private.
# cat $HOME/.docker/config.json
#
# push the repo to the account you logged into (we want this to be silintl/bloom-parse-server
# $ docker push  yourhubdockeraccount/bloom-parse-server
